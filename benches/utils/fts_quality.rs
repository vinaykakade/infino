//! FTS quality — BM25 top-k parity of the supertable search path against a
//! textbook oracle, at bench scale.
//!
//! The speed cells time `bm25_search` and discard what it returns. This
//! module grades what it returns: for every shape in [`QUALITY_BATTERY`]
//! and every `k` in [`QUALITY_KS`], the engine's top-k is compared with a
//! reference computed directly from the BM25 formula over the whole
//! corpus. The vector cells have had this (recall against brute-force
//! truth) from the start; this is the FTS equivalent.
//!
//! ## Two references, one corpus pass
//!
//! The engine deliberately differs from textbook BM25 in two places, and a
//! quality number has to separate those design costs from kernel bugs:
//!
//! * **Length quantization.** A document's length is stored in one byte
//!   (`stored_len`): exact below 16 tokens, truncated downward by up to
//!   one bucket above. On a corpus with realistic length variation this
//!   reorders near-ties.
//! * **Sharded statistics.** Under [`Bm25Stats::PerSuperfile`]
//!   each superfile scores with its own document count and term
//!   frequencies; [`Bm25Stats::Global`] uses table-wide idf but still each
//!   superfile's own average document length.
//!
//! So the oracle scores every matching document twice from the same
//! statistics: **T**, textbook BM25 with the exact length, and **Q**, the
//! BM25 the engine is specified to compute, with the stored length. The
//! table then reports, per query and `k`:
//!
//! | column | definition |
//! |---|---|
//! | recall vs BM25 | engine top-k under `Global` graded against T — the user-facing quality, including the quantization and avgdl costs |
//! | recall (default stats) | the same under `PerSuperfile` — the default mode's sharded-idf drift |
//! | recall vs engine BM25 | engine top-k under `Global` graded against Q, a hit allowed to fall short of the k-th score by the avgdl residual — must be ≈ 1.0; a drop is a kernel or pruning bug. **Gated.** |
//! | max score Δ | largest relative gap between an engine score and Q for the same document (`Global`). **Gated** at the avgdl residual. |
//!
//! Q is exact except for one input: the engine normalizes with each
//! superfile's own average document length, the oracle with the
//! corpus-wide one. That residual is a sampling error that shrinks as
//! `1/sqrt(docs per superfile)` — 5% is the gate at the 10M reference
//! scale and it widens accordingly on smaller smoke-test corpora
//! ([`residual_tolerance`]).
//!
//! Recall is **tie-aware**: a returned document counts as a hit when its
//! oracle score is at least the oracle's k-th score (within a rounding
//! tolerance), so the engine picking a different member of a tied group at
//! the boundary is not penalized. On a bursty corpus single-term queries
//! tie heavily at the boundary; doc-id set overlap would report noise.
//!
//! ## Why a streaming oracle
//!
//! The test-suite reference (`BruteForceBm25`) keeps every token of every
//! document and is unusable at 10M docs. This oracle re-derives the corpus
//! from its seed one scheduling chunk at a time and keeps only what the
//! battery needs: each document's length and its term frequencies for the
//! few dozen terms (and phrases) the battery mentions — a sparse table of
//! a few tens of millions of entries at 10M docs. Both sides tokenize and
//! parse with the table's own tokenizer, so tokenization and clause
//! semantics cannot diverge by construction.
