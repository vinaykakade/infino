//! Supertable object-store bench (infino-only entry point).
//!
//! Multi-segment ingest to object storage at the supertable scale
//! (`INFINO_BENCH_SUPERTABLE_DOCS`, default 10M), built through the
//! production `SupertableWriter::append` + `commit` path. Three index
//! shapes are measured for apples-to-apples comparison against
//! single-modality peers: FTS-only, vector-only, and combined FTS +
//! vector.
//!
//! **Real AWS S3 only.** The multi-commit build relies on conditional
//! `If-Match` PUTs that the `s3s-fs` emulator does not implement, and a
//! local filesystem backend would not measure object-store behavior, so
//! this bench requires `INFINO_REAL_S3_BUCKET` (+ AWS creds) and exits with
//! a message otherwise. Every object the run writes lands under one unique
//! prefix per shape, all of which are deleted before the runner returns.
//!
//! ## Per-shape process isolation
//!
//! Each shape is built in its **own subprocess** (the parent re-execs this
//! same bench binary with `INFINO_BENCH_SUPERTABLE_SHAPE=<shape>`). RSS is
//! sampled inside that child, so each shape's Peak/Median/P90 are measured
//! from a clean address space. Within a single process `VmRSS` is a
//! monotonic high-water mark — the allocator does not return freed pages to
//! the OS — so running all three shapes in one process would let whichever
//! ran first poison the memory numbers of the ones after it. Isolation makes
//! the three rows independent and comparable.
//!
//! ## Invocation
