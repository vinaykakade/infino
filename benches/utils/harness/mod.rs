//! Engine-generic benchmark harness.
//!
//! Defines the [`FtsEngine`] trait so one driver ([`run_fts`]) can
//! measure infino and other retrieval engines through identical code.
//! infino ships the reference implementation ([`InfinoFtsEngine`]); the
//! external comparison crate (`retrievalbench`) implements the trait for
//! other engines (Tantivy, DuckDB, LanceDB, CoreDB) and drives them all
//! the same way, against a byte-identical [`crate::corpus::MmapTextCorpus`].
//!
//! The three verbs the driver measures are:
//!
//!   - [`FtsEngine::open`]  — prepare an empty index for one column.
//!   - [`FtsEngine::write`] — ingest every document and seal the index
//!     ready to query (the build phase).
//!   - [`FtsEngine::read`]  — run a BM25 query (the search phase).
//!
//! Memory (RSS) and timing reuse the same [`crate::rss`] sampler the
//! in-tree infino benches use, so internal and comparison numbers are
//! produced by one measurement path.
