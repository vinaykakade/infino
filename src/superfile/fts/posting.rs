//! PFOR-delta block codec for posting lists.
//!
//! Postings are encoded in fixed-size **128-doc blocks** (matching
//! `BitPacker4x::BLOCK_LEN` for SIMD-friendly bit-packing). Each block
//! stores a sorted run of `doc_ids` (delta-encoded relative to a base
//! doc id) plus per-doc `tfs`, both bit-packed at the minimum width
//! needed for that block. A block is decodable given its bytes and the
//! previous block's last doc id (which the skip table carries), so the
//! skip table can jump straight to a block.
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/superfile.md` for the overall posting region
//! layout and how blocks chain into the BM25 + BlockMaxWAND query loop.
//!
//! ## On-disk block layout
//!
//! Two header layouts exist, chosen by the blob version
//! (`format::fts::BlockLayout`). The **compact** header (current) is one 32-bit
//! little-endian word:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bits    field
//!   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!   0..7    doc_count - 1       (1..=128 docs)
//!   7..13   delta_bits          (0..=32, bit-width for deltas)
//!   13..19  tf_bits             (0..=32, bit-width for tfs)
//!   19..24  n_delta_exceptions  (patched blocks; 0 otherwise)
//!   24..26  encoding            (so byte 3's low two bits are the
//!                                encoding in both layouts)
//!   26..31  n_tf_exceptions     (patched blocks; 0 otherwise)
//!   31      spare (0)
//! ```
//!
//! A packed or patched block's base doc id is not stored: it is the
//! previous block's last doc id, or zero for a term's first block, so
//! `delta[0] = doc[0] - base` is at least one from the second block on.
//! A bitset block's word-aligned origin follows the word as a `u32`
//! (its presence words start at the block's own first doc, not at the
//! previous block's last). The **wide** header (`V1`–`V6`) is the older
//! 8-byte form — `doc_count`, `delta_bits`, `tf_bits`, `encoding` as
//! bytes, then the base or origin as a `u32` — and never carries a
//! patched block.
//!
//! After the header:
//!
//! ```text
//!   16 × delta_bits  packed deltas (always BLOCK_LEN values)
//!   16 × tf_bits     packed tfs    (always BLOCK_LEN values)
//! ```
//!
//! `BLOCK_LEN * delta_bits / 8` is always an integer because
//! `BLOCK_LEN == 128`, so `128 * num_bits` is divisible by 8 for every
//! valid `num_bits` value.
//!
//! Two further encodings share the header and put the tfs last: a
//! **bitset** block ([`ENCODING_BITSET`]) stores dense doc ids as
//! presence words, and a **patched** block ([`ENCODING_PATCHED`]) packs
//! deltas and tfs at the width most lanes fit and lists the outliers as
//! exceptions — see each constant's documentation for its layout.
//!
//! ## Partial last block
//!
//! The last block in a posting list may have `doc_count < BLOCK_LEN`.
//! The encoder pads `doc_ids` with the last real value (delta = 0) and
//! pads `tfs` with zero before bit-packing — this keeps both arrays at
//! the bitpacker's required `BLOCK_LEN` length without inflating the
//! bit width. The header's `doc_count` tells the consumer how many of
//! the decoded slots are real.
//!
//! ## Precondition-check convention
//!
//! - **`assert!`** for O(1) checks (slice length, type fits, header
//!   field in range). Cost is a few cycles per call; runs in release.
//!   Worth the safety net at function boundaries — especially before
//!   handing slices to the bitpacking crate, whose SIMD path uses
//!   `unsafe` writes that assume sufficient destination length.
//! - **`debug_assert!`** for O(n)-or-worse checks (sorted-ness,
//!   per-element content validation). Stripped in release; the cheap
//!   `assert!` preconditions plus the caller's contract carry safety
//!   in production.
