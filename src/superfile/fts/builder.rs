//! FTS blob builder. Multi-column FTS index assembly.
//!
//! `FtsBuilder` accumulates posting records across all FTS-indexed
//! columns and on `finish_to<W>` emits the on-disk FTS blob:
//!
//! ```text
//!   header (48 bytes)
//!   FST term dictionary  + CRC32C
//!   postings region      + CRC32C
//!   doc-lengths directory   + CRC32C
//!   per-column doc-lengths arrays  (each + its own CRC32C)
//! ```
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/superfile.md` for the full byte-level spec.
//!
//! ## Build architecture
//!
//! Two-mode accumulator, threshold-based, identical in shape to
//! `VectorBuilder`:
//!
//! - **In-RAM mode**: each column holds a `FxHashMap<term, Vec<(doc,
//!   tf)>>` until total accumulated bytes cross
//!   `spill_threshold_bytes` (default 256 MiB). Small builds never
//!   touch the disk during `add_doc`.
//! - **Spill mode**: once the threshold is crossed, that column's
//!   terms are interned into a per-column `term_to_id`/`id_to_term`
//!   pair, the in-memory map is drained into per-column hash-
//!   partitioned spill files holding **fixed-size 12-byte
//!   `(term_id_le, doc_id_le, tf_le)` triples**, and from then on
//!   `add_doc` writes one triple per posting straight to the spill
//!   files via buffered file IO. Same shape as vector's spill: no
//!   per-record framing, no variable-length payload, no per-record
//!   allocation on read.
//!
//! `finish_to<W: Write>` correspondingly has two paths:
//!
//! - **In-RAM finish**: no column spilled. Per-column maps are
//!   drained, sorted, encoded into a posting-region scratch file,
//!   and the FST is built in RAM (small).
//! - **Spilled finish**: at least one column has spilled. The
//!   spilled column's `id_to_term` builds a lex-rank lookup
//!   (`term_id → rank in lex order`, one `Vec<u32>` per column,
//!   bounded by vocab so small even at 10M docs). Partition files
//!   are read as fixed-size triples, sorted by
//!   `(lex_rank[term_id], doc_id)` (pdqsort over `[(u32, u32,
//!   u32)]` — pure u32 compares, no `&[u8]` chasing), then
//!   k-way-merged into global lex order. The FST is built
//!   *streaming* via [`StreamingDictBuilder`] writing to a scratch
//!   file, using `id_to_term[term_id]` to recover the term bytes
//!   per emission. Final blob assembly is `header → FST scratch →
//!   posting scratch → doc-lengths`, all streamed through `W`.
//!
//! Mirror of vector: vector spills its input corpus as raw f32
//! bytes past 256 MiB and streams its centroid+code layout to
//! scratch; FTS spills its posting accumulator as fixed 12-byte
//! triples past 256 MiB and streams its FST + posting region to
//! scratch. Both bound peak resident memory by a formula that does
//! not include `n_docs`, and both use fixed-size, no-framing record
//! formats so the spill IO is allocator-free on the read side.
//!
//! ## Builder lifecycle
//!
//! 1. `FtsBuilder::new(tokenizer)` — empty builder.
//! 2. `register_column(name)` per FTS column, in declaration order.
//! 3. `add_doc(column_id, local_doc_id, text)` per `(doc, column)` pair.
//!    Caller passes monotonically-increasing `local_doc_id`s.
//! 4. `finish()` (returns `Vec<u8>`) or `finish_to(impl Write)`
//!    (streams the blob progressively to any sink).

/// lifetime tag is a lie maintained by `unsafe` `std::mem::
/// transmute` at insertion (see [`intern_term_id_arena`]) and
/// kept sound by two structural invariants:
///
/// 1. The arena outlives the map. The `Spilled` variant declares
///    `term_arena` *after* `term_to_id` and `id_to_term` so Rust
///    drops it last (struct fields drop in declaration order, so
///    the last-declared field is the last-dropped). The
///    `finish_to` per-column block that destructures `Spilled`
///    likewise puts `term_arena` last in the pattern and adds an
///    explicit `drop(term_arena)` after the last use of
///    `id_to_term` for the same reason.
/// 2. No method on the map's keys does a deref during the map's
///    own `Drop`. `&str` has no `Drop` impl, so dropping the map
///    just deallocates the bucket table without touching the
///    key bytes. The arena can therefore safely outlast the
///    map's body without the map ever needing arena bytes
///    during its own teardown.
///
/// Switching from `Box<str>` keys to arena `&str` keys:
///
///   * removes one `Box<str>` heap allocation per intern miss
///     (was: one for the map key + one cloned for `id_to_term`;
///     now: one bump-arena copy reused by both);
///   * packs all term bytes densely in the bump arena instead
///     of scattering them across the global heap, which keeps
///     the byte-compare fast path inside `raw_entry_mut` cache-
///     hot on the per-token spill-arm hot loop (the bench
///     vocab is ~10K terms × ~5-10 byte average = ~75 KiB
///     total, comfortably L2-resident as one contiguous arena
///     instead of ~10K separate heap allocations chasing

/// LSB-radix variant we tried):
///
/// 1. The sort key is *bounded*. `lex_rank[term_id]` is in
///    `0..vocab_size`. The bench Zipfian column has ~10K vocab; even
///    a 10M-doc supertable column tops out around a few million —
///    the counts table fits comfortably in L2 either way.
/// 2. The secondary key is *free*. Within a partition file, all
///    triples for a fixed `term_id` are appended in strictly
///    increasing `doc_id` order (`add_doc` is called with monotonic
///    `local_doc_id` per `column_id`, and each call emits one
///    triple per unique term in iteration order over
///    `updated_terms`, with all triples for that doc emitted
///    contiguously). So a *stable* sort on `lex_rank[term_id]`
///    leaves the within-rank order as the original `doc_id` order
///    — exactly the `(lex_rank, doc_id)` order the finish-time
///    lex-order partition traversal needs.
/// 3. Counting sort is **one pass to histogram + one pass to
///    scatter**. No `O(log n)` compare chain (pdqsort), no 5–8
///    LSB-byte passes (radix), no comparator chasing `lex_rank`
///    twice per call. Two reads of every triple and one write.
///
/// **Memory shape**: `counts: Vec<u32>` of length
/// `vocab_size + 1` (~40 KiB at 10K vocab), plus the `out: Vec
/// <Triple>` of the same length as `triples` — the same size as the
