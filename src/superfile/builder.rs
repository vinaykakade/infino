//! Top-level superfile builder.
//!
//! **Naming convention.** `SuperfileBuilder` is a single-shot
//! factory — `new → add_batch×N → finish(self) → Vec<u8>`,
//! consumes self, produces one immutable artifact. Contrast
//! [`crate::supertable::SupertableWriter`], which is a long-lived
//! append handle (`append×N → commit`, repeated). The supertable
//! writer internally constructs many superfile builders, one per
//! shard per commit.
//!
//! `SuperfileBuilder` accepts user rows (Arrow batches + per-column
//! vector slices), routes FTS-text columns into a unified `FtsBuilder`,
//! routes vectors into a unified `VectorBuilder`, accumulates the
//! Parquet-bound rows, and on `finish()` produces a single byte buffer
//! that is a valid Parquet file with embedded BM25 + vector blobs
//! between the last row group and a rewritten footer carrying `inf.*`
//! KV metadata pointers.
//!
//! ## Row storage: `Vec<RecordBatch>`
//!
//! Accumulated rows are held as `Vec<RecordBatch>` rather than as
//! per-column Arrow `ArrayBuilder`s. Why:
//!
//!   1. The natural calling pattern at scale is "I already have a
//!      `RecordBatch`" — readers materialize batches, ETL pipelines
//!      build them. Accepting batches end-to-end avoids forcing
//!      callers to decompose into per-column scalars.
//!   2. `add_batch` becomes a zero-copy push: Arrow column buffers
//!      are reference-counted, so we `Arc::clone` the columns
//!      instead of memcpy-ing into builders. O(num_columns) atomic
//!      increments per batch, independent of row count or column
//!      width.
//!   3. Per-column `Box<dyn ArrayBuilder>` would require a typed
//!      downcast per cell on append — a `DataType` match statement
//!      we'd have to maintain as Arrow grows types (decimals,
//!      dictionaries, lists, structs, …).
//!   4. `ArrowWriter::write` takes `RecordBatch` directly, so
//!      `finish()` just iterates and forwards — no intermediate
//!      "drain builders into one big RecordBatch" step.
//!
//! Tradeoff: we hold strong `Arc` references to the caller's column
//! buffers until `finish()`. Callers who hand us a batch can't drop
//! it to reclaim memory mid-build; they share the buffer with us
//! until the build completes. For batch-ETL this is invisible (the
//! caller hands off and forgets); for streaming-with-backpressure it
//! could matter. There is no `add_row(scalars, vectors)` API today
//! — row-at-a-time callers must construct 1-row `RecordBatch`es
//! themselves. A typed `add_row(&[ScalarValue], ...)` helper can be
//! added later if profiling shows row-at-a-time callers need it.
//!
//! ## Tokenizer scope: per-column
//!
//! `BuilderOptions` carries a default `tokenizer: Option<Arc<dyn
//! Tokenizer>>` (required when any FTS column exists) plus a
//! per-column `fts_tokenizers` vec aligned to `fts_columns`; the
//! default seeds every column unless an entry overrides it.
//! `FtsConfig` itself carries only the column name and its positions
//! flag. `FtsBuilder` holds the default tokenizer and a parallel
//! `column_tokenizers` vec — `register_column` uses the default,
//! `register_column_with_tokenizer` sets a per-column analyzer — and
//! dispatches per (column, doc) at `add_doc` time.
//!
//! Two tokenizers ship: the Unicode-aware `StandardTokenizer` (the
//! default) and `AsciiLowerTokenizer`, selectable per column. The
//! `inf.fts.columns` JSON persists each column's tokenizer name, so a
//! column is re-tokenized at rebuild / compaction with the analyzer it
//! was indexed with. Further analyzers (language-specific stemmers, …)
//! implement the `Tokenizer` trait and need no change to this plumbing.
