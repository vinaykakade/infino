//! System-wide configuration for infino.
//!
//! ## Sources
//!
//! [`Config::load`] merges, in increasing precedence:
//!
//!   1. **Embedded defaults.** `config.yaml` in this module is
//!      `include_str!`'d at compile time. Shipping with the binary
//!      means there's always a usable floor.
//!   2. **`/etc/infino/config.yaml`** — system-wide override.
//!   3. **User config.** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/infino/config.yaml`
//!      (or `$HOME/.config/infino/config.yaml` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
//!      is unset).
//!   4. **`./infino.yaml`** — per-project / per-cwd override.
//!
//! Each layer is a partial override — keys absent from a higher
//! layer fall through to lower layers.
//!
//! **Environment variables never override config.** Engine behavior
//! is set exclusively in YAML so a run's effective configuration is
//! readable from files, not reconstructed from process env. (Env
//! overrides existed once and produced silent drift between runs;
//! `env_vars_do_not_override_config` pins the removal.)
//!
//! ## Adding a new field
//!
//! 1. Add the field to [`Config`] with a `serde` rename / default
//!    if appropriate.
//! 2. Add the same key to `config.yaml` with its default value.
//! 3. Add a docstring and a unit test exercising the YAML override
//!    path.
