//! `SupertableOptions` — the immutable per-supertable configuration.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! `SupertableOptions` is the supertable layer's analogue of
//! `superfile::builder::BuilderOptions`, with one structural
//! difference: **the supertable's schema includes vector columns as
//! `FixedSizeList<Float32, dim>` fields**. Callers append a single
//! `RecordBatch` carrying both scalar columns and vector columns;
//! [`utils::vector_split::split_vectors`] pulls the vector columns out at
//! commit time and forwards `(scalar_only_batch, &[&[f32]])` to the
//! underlying `SuperfileBuilder` (whose schema must NOT include
//! vector columns — vectors live only in the embedded vector blob,
//! never in Parquet).
//!
//! ## Validation
//!
//! `SupertableOptions::new` validates everything statically derivable
//! from the schema + config:
//!
//! - `id_column` exists in schema and is `UInt64`.
//! - Each FTS column exists in schema and is `LargeUtf8`.
//! - Each vector column exists in schema as
//!   `FixedSizeList<Float32, dim>` with `list_size == dim`.
//! - `dim` is in [16, 4096] (mirrors the superfile vector range).
//! - No `\x1F` or `inf.` reserved-name characters.
//! - Logical names unique across `fts_columns` and `vector_columns`.
//! - FTS columns require a tokenizer (and vice versa: a tokenizer
//!   without FTS columns is rejected as inconsistent input — caller
//!   bug).
//!
//! Per-row validation (vectors are non-null, schema matches) lives
//! in [`utils::vector_split`](super::utils::vector_split) since it's a runtime
//! check against each input batch.
//!
//! [`utils::vector_split::split_vectors`]: super::utils::vector_split::split_vectors
