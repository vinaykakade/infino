//! Vector kNN fan-out on [`Supertable`](super::super::Supertable).
//!
//! ## Public API
//!
//! The sync, user-facing entry points live on
//! [`Supertable`](super::super::Supertable):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let opts = VectorSearchOptions::new();
//! // Bare call: `_id` + `score` only — no scalar decode.
//! let ids: Vec<RecordBatch> = table.vector_search("emb", &query_vec, 10, opts, None, None)?;
//! // Materialize row data by naming the columns to decode.
//! let rows: Vec<RecordBatch> = table.vector_search(
//!     "emb",
//!     &query_vec,
//!     10,
//!     opts,
//!     None,
//!     Some(&["_id", "title", "score"]),
//! )?;
//! ```
//!
//! Internally these drive the async kernel on the snapshot-pinned
//! [`SupertableReader`], whose `vector_search` (rows) / `vector_hits`
//! ([`SuperfileHit`], superfile-local) methods are the engine-facing
//! surface. Results are sorted by distance *ascending* — smaller is
//! closer (cosine: `1 - dot`, L2-sq: squared distance).
//!
//! ## Strategy
//!
//! Internally pins a snapshot reader and drives the async
//! kernel to completion via the sync→async bridge. The reader
//! holds a pinned `Arc<ManifestSnapshot>`; for each visible superfile we:
//!
//!   1. Fetch the superfile's `SuperfileReader` from the store.
//!   2. Delegate to `SuperfileReader::vector_search`
//!      (cluster-aware IVF + 1-bit RaBitQ shortlist + full-precision
//!      rerank, all inside one superfile).
//!   3. Tag each `(local_doc_id, distance)` with the superfile URI.
//!   4. Concatenate across superfiles and global-top-k by distance.
//!
//! Unlike BM25, vector distances are inherently comparable across
//! superfiles — both cosine and L2-sq are functions of the query
//! and the per-doc vector only, not of superfile-scoped statistics.
//! So the per-superfile top-k → concatenate → global top-k pattern
//! recovers exact recall (modulo each per-superfile IVF's nprobe-
//! driven recall tradeoff, which is identical to the single-
//! superfile case).
//!
//! Fan-out uses centroid pruning:
//!
//!   1. **Score & sort** — compute `distance(query, centroid)`
//!      for each superfile (SIMD-accelerated: AVX-512 / AVX2 /
//!      NEON) and sort ascending. This is free — centroids are
//!      manifest metadata, no S3 GETs.
//!   2. **Search closest** — search the top `k*2` (min 3)
//!      superfiles in parallel (`tokio::spawn` per superfile).
//!      Merge results via bounded heap.
//!
//! Every skipped superfile is a batch of GET requests the
//! object-store-native engine never issues. For cold queries
//! this is the difference between seconds and milliseconds.
