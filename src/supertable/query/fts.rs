//! BM25 fan-out on [`Supertable`](super::super::Supertable).
//!
//! ## Public API
//!
//! The sync, user-facing entry points live on
//! [`Supertable`](super::super::Supertable):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Bare call: `_id` + `score` only — no scalar decode.
//! let ids: Vec<RecordBatch> =
//!     table.bm25_search("title", "rust async", 10, Bm25SearchOptions::new(), None)?;
//!
//! // Materialize row data by naming the columns to decode.
//! let rows: Vec<RecordBatch> =
//!     table.bm25_search("title", "rust async", 10, Bm25SearchOptions::new(), Some(&["_id", "title", "score"]))?;
//!
//! // Unranked candidate sets (Arrow rows, score == 0.0).
//! let any = table.token_match("title", "rust async", BoolMode::Or, None)?;
//! let exact = table.exact_match("title", "rust async", None)?;
//! ```
//!
//! Internally these drive the async kernel on the snapshot-pinned
//! [`SupertableReader`], whose `bm25_search` (rows) / `bm25_hits`
//! ([`SuperfileHit`], superfile-local) / `bm25_search_prefix` methods are
//! the engine-facing surface. Ranked results are sorted by score
//! *descending* — higher BM25 score is more relevant.
//!
//! ## Strategy
//!
//! Internally pins a snapshot reader and drives the async
//! kernel to completion via the sync→async bridge. The reader
//! holds a pinned `Arc<ManifestSnapshot>`; for each visible superfile we:
//!
//!   1. Fetch the superfile's `SuperfileReader` from the store.
//!   2. Delegate to `SuperfileReader::bm25_search` /
//!      `bm25_search_prefix` (already implemented at the superfile
//!      layer; per-superfile top-k with BlockMaxWAND skip).
//!   3. Tag each `(local_doc_id, score)` with the superfile URI.
//!   4. Concatenate across superfiles and global-top-k by score.
//!
//! Rayon fan-out runs on `options.reader_pool`. For an N-superfile
//! supertable we issue N parallel per-superfile searches; the pool
//! caps concurrency at the configured reader thread count.
//!
//! ## Score comparability across superfiles
//!
//! This is the classical sharded-BM25 problem: when IDF is computed
//! from each superfile's own `n_docs` and `df`, a rare term in a small
//! superfile can score higher than the same term in a larger one, so
//! per-superfile scores are only approximately comparable and ranking
//! drifts as the table fragments. [`Bm25Stats`] selects how a query
//! handles this:
//!
//!  - [`Bm25Stats::PerSuperfile`] scores each superfile
//!    against its own local statistics — no extra pass, fastest. For
//!    `k ≥ 10` and reasonably balanced superfiles the top-k *set* still
//!    converges to the global answer even if score *order* within the
//!    set wiggles.
//!  - [`Bm25Stats::Global`] gathers the corpus-wide document count and
//!    per-term document-frequencies once (a bloom-pruned, dictionary-
//!    only df pass) and scores every superfile against that single
//!    table-wide IDF, so a fragmented table ranks like one unified
//!    corpus. Costs a df-gather pass before scoring.
//!
//! Oracle tests assert `Global` over a fragmented table reproduces the
//! single-superfile ranking, and that `PerSuperfile` set membership at
//! `k = 10` matches a single-superfile ground truth.
//!
//! ManifestSnapshot-level skip pruning is wired in: each call computes a
//! per-superfile keep/prune mask from the FTS bloom (exact-term
//! mode) or the lex term range (prefix mode) before issuing
//! per-superfile work, so pruned superfiles never trigger a
//! `SuperfileReaderCache::reader` call. Vector + SQL skip remain
//! deferred (see those modules' headers).
