//! `Supertable` + `SupertableReader` — the in-memory handle.
//!
//! `Supertable::create(opts).expect("create")` returns a clone-shared handle holding
//! an empty initial manifest behind `ArcSwap<ManifestSnapshot>`.
//! `Supertable::reader()` does `ArcSwap::load_full` once and pins
//! the resulting `Arc<ManifestSnapshot>` for the reader's lifetime, so a
//! reader captured before a commit keeps seeing pre-commit state
//! even after the writer has swapped in a new manifest.
//!
//! `SupertableInner.writer_outstanding: AtomicBool` is the
//! single-writer slot — the writer flips it true on acquisition
//! and (via `Drop`) flips it false on release.
