// code uses `?` for fallible operations or
// `.expect("invariant: ...")` for paths that are infallible by
// construction. Test/bench code uses `.expect("description")` so a
// failing test panic message tells you which step broke without
// having to count line numbers in the source. The integration tests
// in `tests/` and benches in `benches/` are separate crates; the
// lint is reasserted there via inner attributes.

// `doc_lazy_continuation` fires across a lot of existing doc comments
// where a paragraph wraps a leading punctuation token (`+`, `-`) and
// rustdoc's Markdown parser treats it as a list-item start. The
// rendered docs are fine; rewording each site would distort prose.
// Allowed crate-wide as a style decision.
#![allow(clippy::doc_lazy_continuation)]
// `type_complexity` flags reader-cache and manifest-aggregate state
// types that are intentionally nested. Factoring them into aliases
// adds indirection without clarity at the call sites. Allowed
// crate-wide; revisit when the underlying state shapes stabilize.
#![allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
// `too_many_arguments` flags `disk.rs::finalize_to_mmap` which has 8
// parameters by design (each captures a distinct stage hand-off).
// Restructuring into a builder adds boilerplate without clarity.

// In a normal (non-`test-helpers`) build the internal layers (`config`,
// `storage`, the manifest + WAL + reader-cache + query stack) are
// `pub(crate)`. The curated public surface reaches a large part of them
// (`Connection` builds storage + creates/opens tables; `append` commits;
// the search methods query), but not all of it — the WAL lease/heartbeat
// machinery, cold-fetch cache tiers, config-file loading, and assorted
// deeper query/format helpers are only driven from paths the minimal
// public API doesn't exercise yet, so they read as dead here, and some
// test-facing re-exports go unused. Allow that *only* in this build mode:
// the `test-helpers` build — which CI compiles with `-D warnings` and
// which runs every test/bench — exercises those paths, so genuinely dead
// code (dead even under `test-helpers`) is still caught. Narrow or drop
// this as more of the surface (SQL, cache config) lands.
