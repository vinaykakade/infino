//! Per-op execution work stats — deterministic counters of the physical
//! work one query **or one write** performs, independent of cache
//! temperature (reads) and of pool width / commit contention (writes).
//!
//! Parallel to [`super::io`] (connection-scoped I/O ledger) and [`super::cpu`]
//! (process CPU): this module scopes to a **single op**. A caller wraps a
//! search or a write in [`with_op_stats`]; the reader or writer minted for
//! that op picks the collector up ([`current`]) and threads it through the
//! fan-out, and each kernel flushes its work counters into it. The same query
//! against the same table state reports the same numbers whether the cache
//! was warm or cold — these count what the plan *did*, not what the storage
//! layer happened to fetch (the [`super::io::UsageMeter`] ledger keeps
//! counting actuals).
//!
//! One struct serves both directions deliberately: `update` and `delete`
//! resolve their predicate through a real reader, so a mutation's scan leg
//! reports read counters and its commit leg reports write counters — one
//! scope, one snapshot, both halves of the op's physical work. That scan
//! is the same work a `SELECT` would do and should be priced as read work
//! (exempting it would let `SELECT`-then-delete-by-id dodge the meter).
//!
//! ## Write-side determinism
//!
//! Two things vary on the write path through no fault of the caller: the
//! shard split follows the writer pool's width, and a contended commit
//! retries its publish. The write counters split accordingly:
//! [`OpStats::rows_written`], the three ingested-byte counters, and
//! [`OpStats::rows_tombstoned`] are functions of the batch, the predicate,
//! and the table state alone — one thread or sixteen, first-attempt commit
//! or third. [`OpStats::superfiles_written`],
//! [`OpStats::superfile_bytes_written`], and [`OpStats::fts_terms_indexed`]
//! are width-dependent execution observations, recorded for reconciliation
//! and never to be priced.
//!
//! With no collector installed the per-flush cost is one `Option` check,
//! and the superfile-level kernel-CPU brackets gate their procfs reads on
//! [`metering_active`] (one relaxed atomic load); counters accumulate
//! locally in kernels and flush per superfile / work unit, never inside
//! scoring loops.
//!
//! ## Deliberate exclusions
//!
//! Reads whose cost amortizes across queries or would break the
//! warm/cold invariance are NOT counted, by design: superfile open I/O
//! (footers, subsection headers) and the reader-cached Parquet
//! metadata / page-index parse (paid once per reader lifetime, not per
//! query); tombstone sidecar prefetches and manifest freshness probes
//! (table-state / consistency-policy reads, not plan work); the hidden
//! index's per-generation fast state; and phase C's bookkeeping
//! refetches (cluster index + Sq8 meta re-reads on the warm-only rerank
//! wave — cold runs have no phase C, so pricing them would make the one
//! priced counter temperature-dependent); and the materialization takes'
//! streamed page ranges (a promoted resident reader decodes in place —
//! reader-cache state again; `rows_materialized` carries that leg
//! invariantly). Their expected cost is recovered through a consumer's
//! calibrated rates, never surcharged on the query that happened to pay
//! them.
//!
//! Write-side exclusions, same reasoning: object-store PUT count/bytes
//! (OCC retries, multipart fan-out, and manifest-part rewrites are our
//! contention and our config, not the caller's — the
//! [`super::io::UsageMeter`] ledger keeps the actuals); the deferred
//! storage-reclaim sweep and ingest-triggered hidden-index maintenance
//! (detached tasks never pick up a collector, so they are excluded by
//! the mint discipline). Per-shard build CPU IS measured: the bracket
//! sits inside each shard's pool closure (`fanout_shards_metered`) and
//! the WAL update's build step, on the thread doing the work — a
//! calling-thread bracket would see nothing, since the caller blocks in
//! `pool.install` for the whole fan-out.
